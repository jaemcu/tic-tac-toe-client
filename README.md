Janina's Tic Tac Toe ReadME

Instructions
Instructions are as followed:
1. A user must initially sign-up and sign-in before they will be able to play the game.
2. Once signed in, a user has the option of playing two players by the click of one of squares.
3. Then they are prompted to play as the other player.
4. Then either X or O gets three in a row or the game is a tie.
5. They then can play another game
6. When they are done, they can log out of session.


Technologies Used
  -HTML
  -CSS
  -Javascript
  -BootStrap
  -JQuery

User Stories
  -As a new user, I want instructions on how to play the game 'Tic Tac Toe' so that I can play a game round effectively.
  -As a new user, I want a signal at the end of a game, with which side won so I can confirm if X's or O's won, or even a tie.
  -As a new user, I want a sign-in form so I can access my account during my game time and leave when I want.
  -As a signed in user, I want to be able to keep track of how many games I've won as each side (X's and O's) and visual see so I can keep track of the score.
  -As a signed in user, I want to have a seamless game so that the browser doesn't reload every time I click on something in the application.

Planning
 -User Stories and Wireframe completion
 -Then Setup on Github
 -Started with Token Auth
 -Next Game API
 -Then Game UI
 -Game Engine
 -Game UI again

 If I were to do it again, I would have done the first three steps in the same order, then saved Game API. I would have also worked more actively with a team, then just use myself for the first couple of days.

Unsolved Issues for Future Iteriations
  -I will need to get the code I have written for the API (game create, update, and get) functional.

NOTES:
Meet and discuss User Stories, the wireframe for this project, as well as technologies allowed to be used/concerns about the project.

User Stories
Will add more User Stories/update existing ones to be more concise, then add to README.me for submission with the final project

Wireframe
Understood the foundation of wireframes better (even how some have functional aspects) and how it would be used to present to clients to make the most efficient project environment.

Bootstrap
Discuss whether or not Bootstrap can be used and how to reference it correcting in project (in README.md, connected with the file for access, and in general coding practices when using Frameworks).
