User Stories (add more)?
  -As a new user, I want instructions on how to play the game 'Tic Tac Toe' so that I can play a game round effectively.
  -As a new user, I want a signal at the end of a game, with which side won so I can confirm if X's or O's won, or even a tie.
  -As a new user, I want a sign-in form so I can access my account during my game time and leave when I want.
  -As a signed in user, I want to be able to keep track of how many games I've won as each side (X's and O's) and visual see so I can keep track of the score.
  -As a signed in user, I want to have a seamless game so that the browser doesn't reload every time I click on something in the application.

ISSUE 1- Closed and Conclusion
Meet and discuss User Stories, the wireframe for this project, as well as technologies allowed to be used/concerns about the project.

User Stories
Will add more User Stories/update existing ones to be more concise, then add to README.me for submission with the final project

Wireframe
Understood the foundation of wireframes better (even how some have functional aspects) and how it would be used to present to clients to make the most efficient project environment.

Bootstrap
Discuss whether or not Bootstrap can be used and how to reference it correcting in project (in README.md, connected with the file for access, and in general coding practices when using Frameworks).
