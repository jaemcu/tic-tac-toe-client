NOTE PICTURES:To add images to your project, you must store them in the public directory.
 To use the image in HTML or CSS, write the path to the image like this:

<img src="public/cat.jpg">
or
#my-cool-div {
  background-image: url('public/cat.jpg')
}
Note that there's no ./ or / in front of public/filename.jpg.

RED FLAG: DO WE PUT IN .KEEP OR MAKE A NEW FILE?


NOTE FONTS:To add custom fonts to your app, you can either use a CDN like
Google Fonts, or you can download the fonts and save them in the public
directory. If you use the former method, follow the directions on the website
providing the fonts.

For local fonts, put the files in public, and then import and use them in a
.scss file like this:

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Nature Beauty';
  src: url('public/Nature-Beauty.ttf') format('truetype');
}

.element-with-custom-font {
  font-family: 'Nature Beauty';
}
